        Args:

            name: Name of the airplane [optional]. It can help when debugging to give the airplane a sensible name.

            xyz_ref: An array-like that gives the x-, y-, and z- reference point of the airplane, used when computing
            moments and stability derivatives. Generally, this should be the center of gravity.

                # In a future version, this will be deprecated and replaced with asb.MassProperties.

            wings: A list of Wing objects that are a part of the airplane.

            fuselages: A list of Fuselage objects that are a part of the airplane.

            s_ref: Reference area. If undefined, it's set from the area of the first Wing object. # Note: will be deprecated

            c_ref: Reference chord. If undefined, it's set from the mean aerodynamic chord of the first Wing object. # Note: will be deprecated

            b_ref: Reference span. If undefined, it's set from the span of the first Wing object. # Note: will be deprecated

            analysis_specific_options: Analysis-specific options are additional constants or modeling assumptions
            that should be passed on to specific analyses and associated with this specific geometry object.

                This should be a dictionary where:

                    * Keys are specific analysis types (typically a subclass of asb.ExplicitAnalysis or
                    asb.ImplicitAnalysis), but if you decide to write your own analysis and want to make this key
                    something else (like a string), that's totally fine - it's just a unique identifier for the
                    specific analysis you're running.

                    * Values are a dictionary of key:value pairs, where:

                        * Keys are strings.

                        * Values are some value you want to assign.
