    Definition for a Wing.

    Anatomy of a Wing:

        A wing consists chiefly of a collection of cross sections, or "xsecs". These can be accessed with `Wing.xsecs`,
        which gives a list of xsecs in the Wing. Each xsec is a WingXSec object, a class that is defined separately.

        You may also see references to wing "sections", which are different than cross sections (xsecs)! Sections are
        the portions of the wing that are in between xsecs. In other words, a wing with N cross sections (xsecs,
        WingXSec objects) will always have N-1 sections. Sections are never explicitly defined, since you can get all
        needed information by lofting from the adjacent cross sections. For example, section 0 is a loft between
        cross sections 0 and 1.

        Wings are lofted linearly between cross sections.

    If the wing is symmetric across the XZ plane, just define the right half and supply "symmetric = True" in the
    constructor.

    If the wing is not symmetric across the XZ plane (e.g., a vertical stabilizer), just define the wing.

            analysis_specific_options: Analysis-specific options are additional constants or modeling assumptions
            that should be passed on to specific analyses and associated with this specific geometry object.

                This should be a dictionary where:

                    * Keys are specific analysis types (typically a subclass of asb.ExplicitAnalysis or
                    asb.ImplicitAnalysis), but if you decide to write your own analysis and want to make this key
                    something else (like a string), that's totally fine - it's just a unique identifier for the
                    specific analysis you're running.

                    * Values are a dictionary of key:value pairs, where:

                        * Keys are strings.

                        * Values are some value you want to assign.

            xyz_le: An array-like that represents the xyz-coordinates of the leading edge of the cross section, in

            chord: Chord of the wing at this cross section.

            twist: Twist angle, in degrees, as defined about the leading edge.

                The twist axis is computed with the following procedure:

                    * The quarter-chord point of this WingXSec and the following one are identified.

                    * A line is drawn connecting them, and it is normalized to a unit direction vector.

                    * That direction vector is now the twist axis.

            airfoil: Airfoil associated with this cross section. [aerosandbox.Airfoil]

            control_surfaces: A list of control surfaces in the form of ControlSurface objects.

            analysis_specific_options: Analysis-specific options are additional constants or modeling assumptions
            that should be passed on to specific analyses and associated with this specific geometry object.

                This should be a dictionary where:

                    * Keys are specific analysis types (typically a subclass of asb.ExplicitAnalysis or
                    asb.ImplicitAnalysis), but if you decide to write your own analysis and want to make this key
                    something else (like a string), that's totally fine - it's just a unique identifier for the
                    specific analysis you're running.

                    * Values are a dictionary of key:value pairs, where:

                        * Keys are strings.

                        * Values are some value you want to assign.

                This is more easily demonstrated / understood with an example:

            Note: Control surface definition through WingXSec properties (control_surface_is_symmetric, control_surface_hinge_point, control_surface_deflection)
            is deprecated. Control surfaces should be handled according to the following protocol:
            
                1. If control_surfaces is an empty list (default, user does not specify any control surfaces), use deprecated WingXSec control surface definition properties.
                This will result in 1 control surface at this xsec.
                
                Usage example:

                >>> xsecs = asb.WingXSec(
                >>>     chord = 2
                >>> )

                2. If control_surfaces is a list of ControlSurface instances, use ControlSurface properties to define control surfaces. This will result in as many
                control surfaces at this xsec as there are entries in the control_surfaces list (an arbitrary number >= 1).

                Usage example:

                >>>xsecs = asb.WingXSec(
                >>>    chord = 2,
                >>>    control_surfaces = [
                >>>        ControlSurface(
                >>>            trailing_edge = False
                >>>        )
                >>>    ]
                >>>)

                3. If control_surfaces is None, override deprecated control surface definition properties and do not define a control surface at this xsec. This will
                result in 0 control surfaces at this xsec.

                Usage example:

                >>>xsecs = asb.WingXSec(
                >>>    chord = 2,
                >>>    control_surfaces = None
                >>>)
            
            See avl.py for example of control_surface handling using this protocol.
