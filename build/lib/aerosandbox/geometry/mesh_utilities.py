Documentation of (points, faces) standard format:

Meshes are given here in the common (points, faces) format. In this format, `points` is a Nx3 array, where each row 
gives the 3D coordinates of a vertex in the mesh. Entries into this array are floating-point, generally speaking.

`faces` is a Mx3 array in the case of a triangular mesh, or a Mx4 array in the case of a quadrilateral mesh. Each row 
in this array represents a face. The entries in each row are integers that correspond to the index of `points` where 
the vertex locations of that face are found.

    Takes in a series of tuples (points, faces) and merges them into a single tuple (points, faces). All (points,

    """
    PyVista uses a slightly different convention for the standard (points, faces) format as described above. They
    give `faces` as a single 1D vector of roughly length (M*3), or (M*4) in the case of quadrilateral meshing.
    Basically, the mesh displayer goes down the `faces` array, and when it sees a number N, it interprets that as the
    number of vertices in the following face. Then, the next N entries are interpreted as integer references to the
    vertices of the face.

    This has the benefit of allowing for mixed tri/quad meshes.

    Args:
        points: `points` array of the original standard-format mesh
        faces: `faces` array of the original standard-format mesh

    Returns:

        (points, faces), except that `faces` is now in a pyvista.PolyData compatible format.
