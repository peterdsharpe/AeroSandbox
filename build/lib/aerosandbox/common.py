    This variable, `default_analysis_specific_options`, allows you to specify default values for options that can be used for 
    specific problems. 
    
    This should be a dictionary, where: * keys are the geometry-like types that you might be interested in defining 
    parameters for. * values are dictionaries, where: * keys are strings that label a given option * values are 
    anything. These are used as the default values, in the event that the associated geometry doesn't override those.

        Retrieves the analysis-specific options that correspond to both:

                * In order for this function to do something useful, you probably want this option to have
                `analysis_specific_options` defined. See the asb.Airplane constructor for an example of this.

            * This analysis's default options for this geometry, if any exist.

            * The geometry's declared analysis-specific-options for this analysis, if it exists. These geometry
            options will override the defaults from the analysis.

                * keys are strings, listing specific options

                * values can be any type, and simply state the value of the analysis-specific option following the

        Note: if this analysis defines a set of default options for the geometry type in question (by using
        `self.default_analysis_specific_options`), all keys from the geometry object's `analysis_specific_options`
        will be validated against those in the default options set. A warning will be raised if keys do not
        correspond to those in the defaults, as this (potentially) indicates a typo, which would otherwise be
        difficult to debug.
