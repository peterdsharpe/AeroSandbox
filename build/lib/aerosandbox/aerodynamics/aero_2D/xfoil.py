class XFoil(ExplicitAnalysis):
    """

    An interface to XFoil, a 2D airfoil analysis tool developed by Mark Drela at MIT.

    Requires XFoil to be on your computer; XFoil is available here: https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/

    It is recommended (but not required) that you add XFoil to your system PATH environment variable such that it can
    be called with the command `xfoil`. If this is not the case, you need to specify the path to your XFoil
    executable using the `xfoil_command` argument of the constructor.

    Usage example:

    >>> xf = XFoil(
    >>>     airfoil=Airfoil("naca2412").repanel(n_points_per_side=100),
    >>>     Re=1e6,
    >>> )
    >>>
    >>> result_at_single_alpha = xf.alpha(5)
    >>> result_at_several_CLs = xf.cl([0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9])
    >>> result_at_multiple_alphas = xf.alpha([3, 5, 60]) # Note: if a result does not converge (such as the 60 degree case here), it will not be included in the results.

        Interface to XFoil. Compatible with both XFoil v6.xx (public) and XFoil v7.xx (private, contact Mark Drela at
        MIT for a copy.)

        Args:

            airfoil: The angle of attack [degrees]

            Re: The chord-referenced Reynolds number

            mach: The freestream Mach number

            n_crit: The critical Tollmein-Schlichting wave amplification factor

            xtr_upper: The upper-surface trip location [x/c]

            xtr_lower: The lower-surface trip location [x/c]

            full_potential: If this is set True, it will turn full-potential mode on. Note that full-potential mode
            is only available in XFoil v7.xx or higher. (Unless you have specifically gone through the trouble of
            acquiring a copy of XFoil v7.xx you likely have v6.xx. Version 7.xx is not publicly distributed as of
            2022; contact Mark Drela at MIT for a copy.) Note that if you enable this flag with XFoil v6.xx,
            you'll likely get an error (no output file generated).

            max_iter: How many iterations should we let XFoil do?

            xfoil_command: The command-line argument to call XFoil.

                * If XFoil is on your system PATH, then you can just leave this as "xfoil".

                * If XFoil is not on your system PATH, then you should provide a filepath to the XFoil executable.

                Note that XFoil is not on your PATH by default. To tell if XFoil is not on your system PATH,
                open up a terminal and type "xfoil".

                    * If the XFoil menu appears, it's on your PATH.

                    * If you get something like "'xfoil' is not recognized as an internal or external command..." or
                    "Command 'xfoil' not found, did you mean...", then it is not on your PATH and you'll need to
                    specify the location of your XFoil executable as a string.

                To add XFoil to your path, modify your system's environment variables. (Google how to do this for
                your OS.)

            xfoil_repanel: Controls whether to allow XFoil to repanel your airfoil using its internal methods (PANE
            -> PPAR, both with default settings, 160 nodes)

            verbose: Controls whether or not XFoil output is printed to command line.

            timeout: Controls how long any individual XFoil run (i.e. alpha sweep) is allowed to run before the
            process is killed. Given in units of seconds. To disable timeout, set this to None.

            working_directory: Controls which working directory is used for the XFoil input and output files. By
            default, this is set to a TemporaryDirectory that is deleted after the run. However, you can set it to
            somewhere local for debugging purposes.
