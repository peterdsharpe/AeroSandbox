    Computes the form factor of a fuselage as a function of various geometrical parameters.

    Assumes the body cross section is a rounded square with constant-radius-of-curvature fillets.
    Body cross section can therefore vary from a true square to a true circle.

    Uses the methodology described in:

    GÃ¶tten, Falk; Havermann, Marc; Braun, Carsten; Marino, Matthew; Bil, Cees.
    "Improved Form Factor for Drag Estimation of Fuselages with Various Cross Sections.
    AIAA Journal of Aircraft, 2021. DOI: 10.2514/1.C036032

    https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.C036032

    Assumes fully turbulent flow. Coefficient of determination found in the paper above was 0.95.

    Note: the value returned does not account for any base separation (other than minor aft-closure separation). The
    equations were also fit to relatively-shape-optimized fuselages, and will be overly-optimistic for unoptimized
    shapes.

    Args:

        fineness_ratio: The fineness ratio of the body (length / diameter).

        ratio_of_corner_radius_to_body_width: A parameter that describes the cross-sectional shape of the fuselage.
        Precisely, this is ratio of corner radius to body width.

            * A value of 0 corresponds to a true square.

            * A value of 0.5 (default) corresponds to a true circle.
