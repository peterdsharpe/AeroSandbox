"""
These tests all implement a simple wing aerostructural optimization problem.

Problem is taken from Section 3 of "Geometric Programming for Aircraft Design Optimization" by W. Hoburg and P. Abbeel.
http://web.mit.edu/~whoburg/www/papers/hoburgabbeel2014.pdf

GPKit implementation available at: https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#simple-wing

Each test solves the same problem in a slightly different way, verifying the correct solution is obtained for all flags.

    This is how you would solve the problem without any kind of log-transformation, and honestly, probably how you
    should solve this problem. Yes, log-transforming things into a geometric program makes everything convex,
    which is nice - however, even non-transformed, the problem is unimodal so IPOPT will find the global minimum.

    Forgoing the log-transform also makes the backend math faster, so it's kind of a trade-off. I tend to lean
    towards not log-transforming things unless they'd really cause stuff to blow up (for example, if you have some
    dynamic system where F=ma and mass ever goes negative, things will explode, so I might log-transform mass).

    Anyway, this should solve and get the same solution as the other problem formulations in this test file.
