This test solves the following optimal control problem, borrowed from Problem Set 1 of MIT 6.255 Optimization Methods,
Fall 2020. Professor: Bart Van Parys

----------

Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 

Let x, v, and a be the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time t, respectively. 

By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form:

x[t+1] = x[t] + v[t]
v[t+1] = v[t] + a[t]

We assume that the acceleration is under our control, which is controlled by the rocket thrust. 

In a rough model, the magnitude |a[t]| of the acceleration is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time t.

Suppose that the rocket is initially at rest at the origin, i.e., x[0] = 0 and v[0] = 0. 

We wish the rocket to take off and land softly at distance d unit after T time units, i.e., x[T] = d and v[T] = 0. 

The total fuel consumption of the rocket, given by sum( c[t] * abs(a[t]) ) (where c are positive numbers known to us),
cannot be more than available amount of fuel f. To ensure a smooth trajectory, we want to ensure that the
acceleration of the rocket does not change too abruptly, i.e., abs(a[t+1]-a[t]) is always less than or equal to some
known value delta.

Now, we want to control the rocket in a manner to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max(abs(a[t])), 
subject to the preceding constraints.
