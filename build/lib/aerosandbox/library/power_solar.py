    Computes the (relative) airmass as a function of the (true) solar elevation angle and observer altitude.
    Includes refractive (e.g. curving) effects due to atmospheric density gradient.

    Airmass is the line integral of air density along an upwards-pointed ray, extended to infinity. As a raw
    calculation of "absolute airmass", this would have units of kg/m^2. It varies primarily as a function of solar
    elevation angle and observer altitude. (Higher altitude means less optical absorption.) However,
    "airmass" usually refers to the "relative airmass", which is the absolute airmass of a given scenario divided by
    the absolute airmass of a reference scenario. This reference scenario is when the sun is directly overhead (solar
    elevation angle of 90 degrees) and the observer is at sea level.

    Therefore:

        * Outer space has a (relative) airmass of 0 (regardless of solar elevation angle).

        * Sea level with the sun directly overhead has a (relative) airmass of 1.

        * Sea level with the sun at the horizon has a (relative) airmass of ~31.7. (Not infinity, since the Earth is
        spherical, so the ray eventually reaches outer space.) Some models will say that this relative airmass at the
        horizon should be ~38; that is only true if one uses the *apparent* solar elevation angle, rather than the
        *true* (geometric) one. The discrepancy comes from the fact that light refracts (curves) as it passes through
        the atmosphere's density gradient, with the difference between true and apparent elevation angles reaching a
        maximum of 0.56 degrees at the horizon.

    Solar elevation angle is the angle between the Sun's position and the horizon.
    (Solar elevation angle) = 90 deg - (solar zenith angle)

    Note that for small negative values of the solar elevation angle (e.g., -0.5 degree), airmass remains finite,
    due to ray refraction (curving) through the atmosphere.

    For significantly negative values of the solar elevation angle (e.g., -10 degrees), the airmass is theoretically
    infinite. This function returns 1e100 in lieu of this here.

            * 0 corresponds to North, 90 corresponds to East.

            If the angle between the panel normal and the sun direction is ever more than 90 degrees (e.g. the panel

            * 'polluted': Urban atmosphere conditions.

        albedo: The fraction of light that hits the ground that is reflected. Affects illumination from re-scattering
        when panels are tilted. Typical values for general terrestrial surfaces are 0.2, which is the default here.
