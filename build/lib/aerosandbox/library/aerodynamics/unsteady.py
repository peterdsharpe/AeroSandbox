#         Welcome to the unsteady aerodynamics library!
# In here you will find analytical, time-domain models for the
# unsteady lift response of thin airfoils. Here is a quick overview 
# of what's been implemented so far:

# 1) Unsteady pitching (Wagner's problem)
# 2) Transverse wing-gust encounters (Kussner's problem)
# 3) Added mass 
# 4) Pitching maneuver through a gust (Combination of all 3 models above)

# The models usually take Callable objects as arguments which given the reduced time, return the quantity of 
# interest (Velocity profile, angle of attack etc.). For an explanation of reduced time see function calculate_reduced_time.


# In main() you will find some example gusts as well as example pitchig profiles.
# You can easily build your own and pass them to the appropriate functions  
# to instantly get the lift response! Although not yet implemented, it is possible to 
# calculate an optimal unsteady maneuver through any known disturbance.

# If you run this file as is, the lift history of a flat plate pitching through a 
# top hat gust will be computed.
