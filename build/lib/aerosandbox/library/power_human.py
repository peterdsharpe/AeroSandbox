    Data Source: Bicycling Science by D. Wilson, 2004. Figure 2.4.
        Wilson is aggregating many data sources here.
        The raw data pulls from a variety of sources:
            * NASA SP-3006, 1964
            * U.K. amateur trials and time-trials records (Whitt, F.R. 1971 "A note on the estimation of the energy expenditure of sporting cyclists." Ergonomics 14)
            * Wilsons' own analyses
    Weight estimates for tests subjects are unfortunately not given.
