    "# Feasibility Problems or Solving Systems of Nonlinear Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use an optimization algorithm and are trying to describe the quality of a given design point in that design space, there are two adjectives that come up often. Let's define them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Feasibility*: This means that the point lies within the feasible region of the design space, i.e. no constraints are violated. This is also referred to as \"primal feasibility\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Optimality*: This means that if we move an infinitesimal amount in **any** *feasible direction* (a direction that doesn't cause us to violate constraints if we take this infinitesimal step), we won't find a point that is better. In lay terms, \"this point is better than or equal to all of its neighbors\". This is also referred to as \"dual feasibility\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the goal of our algorithm is to find a point that is both feasible and optimal. Is this problem we're asking [well-posed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-posed_problem)? In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does a solution exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is that solution unique?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is the solution stable w.r.t. perturbations in problem parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, in the case of a continuous, unimodal problem, the answer is generally *yes*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, however, we're only concerned with feasibility and not optimality. Another way to state this would be that we might have a scenario where all feasible solutions are equally optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would we encode this in AeroSandbox?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could either write:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `opti.minimize(0)`, which explicitly says that the performance of any feasible design is zero everywhere, and hence any feasible solution is equally optimal. We could also replace `0` with any other constant value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could simply not write any kind of `opti.minimize()` statement, in which case the solver will default to `opti.minimize(0)` (effectively, no objective function.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feasibility Problems in Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Feasibility problems can come up in the case of engineering design, albeit not often. With feasibility problems, the problem is often not well-posed, because the solution may not be unique. That doesn't mean it's unsolvable; it simply means that it's difficult to tell *a priori* what our solution will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "A code example of this follows. Here, we pose the trivial problem of finding some value of $x$ that satisfies $1 < x < 2$. We naively guess that $x = 5$:"

    "So, we got a feasible solution! However, notice that the solution is some apparently-random (but deterministic) value between 1 and 2; it is not simply the value of the initial guess projected directly onto the nearest boundary of the feasible space (which would have given us $x \\approx 2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, here, there are infinite solutions arranged on a line between $x=1$ and $x=2$. All solutions are adjacent - take an infinitesimal step from any optimal point, and you'll get another optimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This same thing can happen in higher dimensions, though it can be less obvious because the \"lines\" or \"hyperplanes\" of optimality are not necessarily axis-aligned. Because of that, when you suspect you have a design problem that you expect has this kind of geometry (an infinite number of adjacent optimal solutions), you might try adding a slight regularization term (such as a very weak quadratic penalty term) in order to \"select\" a single solution from all of the optima.\n",
