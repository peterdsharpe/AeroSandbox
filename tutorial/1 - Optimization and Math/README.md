Note that this folder a primer on the optimization syntax associated with AeroSandbox; some prior familiarity with mathematical optimization is assumed. For great primers on engineering design optimization as a field, consider the following excellent texts:

* **"Algorithms for Optimization" by Kochenderfer and Wheeler, 2019**: an amazingly readable and meticulously illustrated intro to optimization - really lovely read. Great details on related topics, like surrogate modeling and sampling plans, as well.

* **"Engineering Design Optimization" by Martins and Ning, 2020**: an equally enjoyable read with more of a tilt towards multidisciplinary design optimization and associated architectures. Fantastic resource, especially for gradient-based methods and big-picture things like problem formulation of coupled systems. Best of all, the authors have made the book totally free [here](http://flowlab.groups.et.byu.net/mdobook.pdf) - an amazing contribution to the open-source community.

* **"Nonlinear Optimization" by Nocdeal and Wright, 2006**: the predecessor of this modern round of optimization books. Great read to get one up to speed on the fundamentals from first principles, and especially useful for those "Hey what do all those funny numbers coming out of IPOPT mean?" questions.
