    "* Primary reference is the associated model in [GPLibrary](https://github.com/convexengineering/gplibrary/tree/master/gpkitmodels/SP/SimPleAC)\n",

    "\n",
    "Granted, this isn't a true head-to-head speed comparison, as we removed extraneous variables here. And, if we were to track parametric sensitivities as well, the speed advantage of AD would also shrink. However, the AD approach is clearly *at the very least* competitive speed-wise with GP while being vastly more generalizable to non-GP, nonconvex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, we do need to concede a drawback of the AD approach over the GP approach:\n",
    "* The AD approach is not guaranteed to converge for all initial guesses; indeed, if one guesses random values that aren't within 1 or 2 orders of magnitude of the optimal values, convergence tends to be difficult. However, on engineering design problems, we can usually easily make good enough guesses based on intuition. As an example, based on SimPleAC:\n",
    "    * Recall that the optimal cruise airspeed is 57 m/s, and our naive initial guess for this value was 100 m/s.\n",
    "    * If we change the initial guess to 1,000 m/s (Mach ~3), it still converges easily to the same optimum in just 31 iterations.\n",
    "    * If we change the initial guess to 10,000 m/s (Mach ~30), it does not converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another stated advantage of the GP approach is that global optimality is guaranteed; however, I argue that this is a misleading claim:\n",
    "* If the true underlying problem is unimodal (i.e. there is only one local optimum, which is the global optimum), then any solution returned by either GPKit or a modern NLP solver (like IPOPT, which AeroSandbox uses), will be globally optimal.\n",
    "    * If the initial guesses or scaling are poor, the NLP solver might fail to find a solution in a case where GPKit would not fail; however, this is a different problem than the NLP solver returning a solution that is locally-but-not-globally optimal.\n",
    "* If the true underlying problem is multimodal, then:\n",
    "    * In the GP approach: the problem is, by definition, not GP-compatible as-is. Therefore, we must force the problem to be GP-compatible by:\n",
    "        * Surrogate modeling, in which case we are solving a different, unimodal approximation of the original problem. Hence, we're not solving the true engineering problem so global optimality guaranatees are meaningless.\n",
    "            * Example: If a problem has a subsonic optimum and a supersonic optimum, and we force it to be GP-compatible by fitting a GP-compatible model to the subsonic branch, we can no longer make global optimality claims of the true underlying problem.\n",
    "        * Signomial programming, in which case we give up global optimality guarantees anyway.\n",
    "    * In the AD approach: we have no global optimality guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: if you solve a multimodal problem by approximating it as a unimodal one, then of course you are going to get the global optimum of your approximation - this is true whether you use a GP solution or an NLP solution. But that doesn't mean you can claim global optimality on the original problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I'd argue that both the GP approach and the AD approach have identically strong claims on whether their solutions are \"globally optimal\", regardless of whether the underlying engineering problem is GP-compatible or not."
