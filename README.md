**AeroSandbox is a Python package that helps you design and optimize aircraft and other engineered systems.**

At its heart, AeroSandbox is an optimization suite that combines the ease-of-use of [familiar NumPy syntax](aerosandbox/numpy) with the power of [modern automatic differentiation](./tutorial/10%20-%20Miscellaneous/03%20-%20Resources%20on%20Automatic%20Differentiation.md).

This automatic differentiation dramatically improves optimization performance on large problems: **design problems with tens of thousands of decision variables solve in seconds on a laptop**. AeroSandbox also comes with dozens of end-to-end-differentiable aerospace physics models, allowing you to **simultaneously optimize an aircraft's aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, mission trajectory, stability, and more.** 

Keeping AeroSandbox easy to learn and use is a top priority. *Complexity is optional* - you can use AeroSandbox's built-in physics models where helpful, or you can drop in arbitrary custom physics models of your own.

```
pip install aerosandbox[full]
```

### What can I do with AeroSandbox?

Use AeroSandbox to design and optimize entire aircraft:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="50%" valign="top">
            <p align="center">
                <a href="https://github.com/peterdsharpe/Feather-RC-Glider"><i>Feather</i> (an ultra-lightweight 1-meter-class RC motor glider)</a>

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Use AeroSandbox to support real-world aircraft development programs, all the way from your very first sketch to your first-flight and beyond:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="50%" valign="top">
            <p align="center">

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Use AeroSandbox to explore counterintuitive, complicated design tradeoffs, all at the earliest stages of conceptual design *where these insights make the most difference*:

Or, throw all the airplane-design-specific code out entirely, and use AeroSandbox purely as an optimization solver or as a solver for nonlinear systems of equations (or ODEs, or PDEs):

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width="50%" valign="top">
			<p align="center">

And much, much more. Best of all, combine these tools arbitrarily without any loss in optimization speed and without any tedious derivative math, all thanks to AeroSandbox's end-to-end automatic-differentiability.

## Getting Started

### Installation

In short:

* `pip install aerosandbox[full]` for a complete install.

* `pip install aerosandbox` for a lightweight (headless) installation with minimal dependencies. All optimization, numerics, and physics models are included, but optional visualization dependencies are skipped.

For more installation details (e.g., if you're new to Python), [see here](./INSTALLATION.md).

### Tutorials, Examples, and Documentation

To get started, [check out the tutorials folder here](./tutorial/)! All tutorials are viewable in-browser, or you can open them as Jupyter notebooks by cloning this repository.

For a more detailed and theory-heavy introduction to AeroSandbox, please see the [author's PhD thesis](./tutorial/sharpe-pds-phd-AeroAstro-2024-thesis.pdf) and [master's thesis](./tutorial/sharpe-pds-sm-AeroAstro-2021-thesis.pdf).

For a developer-oriented description of AeroSandbox internal modules, [please see the developer README](aerosandbox/README.md).

For fully-detailed API documentation, see [the documentation website](https://aerosandbox.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

You can print documentation and examples for any AeroSandbox object by using the built-in `help()` function (e.g., `help(asb.Airplane)`). AeroSandbox code is also documented *extensively* in the source and contains hundreds of unit test examples, so examining the source code can also be useful.

### Usage Details

#### Units

One final point to note: **all inputs and outputs to AeroSandbox are expressed in base SI units, or derived units thereof** (e.g., m, kg, sec, N, m/s, J, Pa). Since this unit system is [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(units_of_measurement)), an [enormous number of quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit) can be converted without any scaling factors. This improves readability and reduces the likelihood of errors.

There are only two exceptions to this SI-everywhere rule:
1. If alternate units are noted in a variable name's suffix. For example:

   * `battery_capacity` â Joules
   * `battery_capacity_watt_hours` â Watt-hours
   * `aircraft_endurance` â Seconds
   * `aircraft_endurance_hours` â Hours

2. Angle of attack (`alpha`, Î±) and sideslip angle (`beta`, Î²) are given in degrees due to long-standing aerospace convention. All other angles and angular rates use radians. 
 
Also, in case of any confusion on the units of a function's inputs and outputs, units are listed on all function docstrings.

If you wish to use other units, consider using [`aerosandbox.tools.units`](./aerosandbox/tools/units.py) to convert easily.
