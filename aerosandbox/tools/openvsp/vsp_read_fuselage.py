def vsp_read_fuselage(fuselage_id):
    """This reads an OpenVSP fuselage geometry and writes it to a aerosandbox fuselage format.

    Assumptions:
    1. OpenVSP fuselage is "conventionally shaped" (generally narrow at nose and tail, wider in center). 
    2. Fuselage is designed in VSP as it appears in real life. That is, the VSP model does not rely on
       superficial elements such as canopies, stacks, or additional fuselages to cover up internal lofting oddities.
    3. This program will NOT account for multiple geometries comprising the fuselage. For example: a wingbox mounted beneath
       is a separate geometry and will NOT be processed.
    4. Fuselage origin is located at nose. VSP file origin can be located anywhere, preferably at the forward tip
       of the vehicle or in front (to make all X-coordinates of vehicle positive).
    5. Written for OpenVSP 3.24
    
    Inputs:
    0. Pre-loaded VSP vehicle in memory, via vsp_read.
    1. VSP 10-digit geom ID for fuselage.
