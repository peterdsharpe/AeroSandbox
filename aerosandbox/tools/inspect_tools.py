    """
    Gets the file location where this function itself (`get_caller_source_location()`) is called.

    This is not usually useful by itself. However, with the use of the `stacklevel` argument, you can get the call
    location at any point arbitrarily high up in the call stack from this function.

    This potentially lets you determine the file location where any Python object was declared.

    Examples:

        Consider the file below (and assume we somehow have this function in scope):

        my_file.py:
        >>> def my_func():
        >>>     print(
        >>>         get_caller_source_location(stacklevel=2)
        >>>     )
        >>>
        >>> if_you_can_see_this_it_works = my_func()

        This will print out the following:
        (/path/to/my_file.py, 5, "if_you_can_see_this_it_works = my_func()\n")

    Args:

        stacklevel: Choose the level of the stack that you want to retrieve source code at. Higher integers will get
        you higher (i.e., more end-user-facing) in the stack. Same behaviour as the `stacklevel` argument in
        warnings.warn().

        truncate_stacklevel: If True, will truncate the stacklevel to the maximum possible value. This
        allows handling of an error case where the supplied `stacklevel` argument exceeds the depth of the
        actual call stack.

    Returns: A tuple of:
        (filename, lineno, code_context)

        * `filename`: a Path object (see `pathlib.Path` from the standard Python library) of the file where this function was called.

        * `lineno`: the line number in the file where this function was called.

        * `code_context`: the immediate line of code where this function was called. A string. Note that, in the case of
        multiline statements, this may not be a complete Python expression. Includes the trailing newline character ("\n") at the end.

        code_context: Optional. Should be a string containing the immediate line of code at this location. If
        provided, allows short-circuiting (bypassing file I/O) if the line is a complete expression.

        strip_lines: A boolean flag about whether or not to strip leading and trailing whitespace off each line of a
        multi-line function call. See the built-in string method `str.strip()` for behaviour.
